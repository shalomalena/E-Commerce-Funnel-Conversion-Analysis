# E-Commerce Funnel Optimization: Data-Driven Conversion Analysis

### **Overview**
This project analyzes over **500,000 user events** from a multi-category e-commerce store to identify **conversion bottlenecks** and propose **data-driven strategies** to increase revenue.

>  **Key Insight:** 40% of users who add items to their cart abandon without purchasing ‚Äî a $204,000 revenue opportunity.  
> By implementing targeted cart abandonment strategies, the company could increase conversions by **25%**.

---

## Executive Summary

- Built with **Python (pandas, scikit-learn, seaborn)**, **SQL**, and **Tableau**.
- Performed funnel, cohort, and predictive analyses to identify and quantify conversion drivers.
- Modeled user purchase behavior using **logistic regression (93% accuracy, 0.87 ROC-AUC)**.
- Simulated multiple **A/B testing strategies** to estimate potential revenue lift.

---

## Business Objectives

The analysis addresses four key questions:
1. Where do users drop off in the purchase funnel?
2. What factors predict whether a user completes a purchase?
3. Which customer segments have the highest conversion potential?
4. What interventions can most effectively increase revenue?

## Skills & Methodology

### Data Engineering
- Extracted and cleaned 500K+ event records.
- Transformed raw logs into structured funnel stages.
- Aggregated data at the user level using **SQL-style queries**.
- Created time-based and behavioral features.
- Handled missing data (32% in category codes, 15% in brand names).

### Data Analytics
- Calculated funnel conversion rates for each stage.
- Performed **cohort analysis** to identify temporal patterns.
- Measured drop-off and retention rates to isolate key friction points.

### Statistical Modeling
- Trained **logistic regression** to predict purchase probability.
- Achieved **93% accuracy** and **0.87 ROC-AUC**.
- Identified key features influencing purchase behavior.
- Conducted feature importance and coefficient analysis.

### A/B Testing & Experimentation
- Simulated five intervention strategies.
- Conducted **chi-square significance testing**.
- Estimated **expected lift** and **revenue impact** for each scenario.

### Data Visualization
- Built interactive dashboards in **Tableau**.
- Created funnel, cohort, and trend charts for executive insights.

## Business Impact

| Strategy | Expected Lift | Revenue Impact |
|-----------|----------------|----------------|
| Limited-Time Discount | +25% | $204,147 |
| Free Shipping Offer | +22% | $179,490 |
| Cart Abandonment Email | +15% | $122,311 |
| Simplified Checkout | +12% | $97,849 |

> Implementing time-sensitive discounts and abandonment emails could increase revenue by over **$200K** in the next campaign cycle.

---

## Strategic Recommendations

### Immediate (Weeks 1‚Äì2)
- Launch **cart abandonment email** to the 1,328 high-probability users.
- Run an **A/B test** for limited-time discount offers on high-value categories.

###  Short-Term (Months 1‚Äì3)
- Reduce **choice overload** with improved product filtering.
- Optimize ad spend for **9 AM‚Äì12 PM** conversion window.

### Long-Term (Quarter 2+)
- Deploy logistic regression as a **real-time scoring model**.
- Automate user retargeting and re-train the model periodically.
- Focus on **category-specific** marketing for high-converting segments.

---

## Next Steps

### Validate Findings
- Extend analysis to more months (e.g., Oct & Dec).
- Segment by **device type** and **customer type** (new vs. returning).

### Production Implementation
- Automate daily funnel tracking.
- Build a real-time Tableau dashboard for business stakeholders.
- Deploy model as an API for live predictions.

### Advanced Analytics
- Add **customer lifetime value (CLV)** and **multi-touch attribution**.
- Introduce **time-series forecasting** for demand and inventory planning.
